The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis of ![marathon data from the year 2017](https://github.com/MownikaKonamaneni/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/project-01/data/marathon_results_2017.csv). The analysis included exploring the number of finishers by age group, visualizing the age distribution of finishers, investigating the age distribution based on gender, and determining the top 10 countries with the fastest runners based on average finishing time. The visualizations provided insights into the demographics and performance of marathon runners, allowing for a better understanding of the dataset.

**Data Analysis and visualization**
Performed below data analysis on the Marathon dataset:

1. **Number of Finishers by Age Group**: The count of finishers is calculated for each age group. This information is then visualized using a bar plot. The bar plot showcasing the number of finishers by age group revealed that the highest number of finishers fell within the age group of 40-45, followed closely by the age group of 45-50. The number of finishers gradually increase with age until mid40's, then it starts gradually decreased with increasing age.
2. **Age Distribution of Finishers**: To understand the age distribution of finishers, a histogram is created with density estimation. The histogram depicting the age distribution of finishers indicated a relatively normal distribution with a peak in the mid-40s. This finding suggests that individuals in their mid-40s participate in marathons more frequently compared to other age groups.
3. **Age Distribution based on Gender**: The age distribution is further analyzed based on gender by creating a histogram with density estimation and differentiating between male and female runners. The histogram comparing the age distribution based on gender highlighted interesting differences. Age distribution of Women finishers is on lower scale compared to men. Which means on an average women finishers have lower age compared to men.
4. **Top 10 Countries with the Fastest Runners**: The data is grouped by country, and the average finishing time is calculated for each country. The top 10 countries with the fastest runners, based on average finishing time, are selected and visualized using a bar plot. The analysis of average finishing times for each country allowed us to identify the top 10 countries with the fastest runners. Among them, ZIM (Zimbabwe), KEN (Kenya), BRN (Brunei), and ETH (Ethiopia) stood out as leading countries in terms of marathon performance, with only minor differences distinguishing them. Notably, ZIM (Zimbabwe) emerged as the country with the fastest runners.

## Project 02

In this project, I explored  Analyze the World cup matches data from 1930 to 2014. The dataset used for analysis is !["WorldCupMatches.csv"](https://github.com/MownikaKonamaneni/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/project-02/data/WorldCupMatches.csv)  and Visualization of Model fitting on ![Heart disease diagnostic data](https://github.com/MownikaKonamaneni/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/project-02/data/Heart.csv) and its coefficient plot. 

**Data analysis and visualization**
1. Visualize the average number of goals scored by the away team and the home team on maps. 
2. Analyze the number of matches won by the home team and the away team as the outcome of the match.
3. Determine the total number of goals scored in each match.
4. Analyze the heart disease prediction dataset.
5. Fit a model to the heart disease data and determine its coefficients and metrics.

Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.
