The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis of ![marathon data from the year 2017](https://github.com/MownikaKonamaneni/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/project-01/data/marathon_results_2017.csv). 

**Data analysis and visualization**
The analysis included exploring the number of finishers by age group, visualizing the age distribution of finishers, investigating the age distribution based on gender, and determining the top 10 countries with the fastest runners based on average finishing time. The visualizations provided insights into the demographics and performance of marathon runners, allowing for a better understanding of the dataset.

**Data Analysis and visualization**
Performed below data analysis on the Marathon dataset:

1. Number of Finishers by Age Group
2. Age Distribution of Finishers
3. Age Distribution based on Gender
4. Determine the top 10 countries with the fastest runners based on average finishing time.
 
Find the code and report in the `project_01/` folder.

**Distribution of number of finishers by age group with bar plot:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored  Analyze the World cup matches data from 1930 to 2014. The dataset used for analysis is !["WorldCupMatches.csv"](https://github.com/MownikaKonamaneni/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/project-02/data/WorldCupMatches.csv)  and Visualization of Model fitting on ![Heart disease diagnostic data](https://github.com/MownikaKonamaneni/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/project-02/data/Heart.csv) and its coefficient plot. 

**Data analysis and visualization**
1. Visualize the average number of goals scored by the away team and the home team on maps. 
2. Analyze the number of matches won by the home team and the away team as the outcome of the match.
3. Determine the total number of goals scored in each match.
4. Analyze the heart disease prediction dataset.
5. Fit a model to the heart disease data and determine its coefficients and metrics.

Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

## Project 03

In this project, I explored methods to create different types of data visualizations (such as density plots, density ridge plots, etc ) using the dataset obtained from ![FSU's Florida Climate Center](https://github.com/MownikaKonamaneni/dataviz_final_project/blob/main/data/tpa_weather_2022.csv) , for a station at Tampa International Airport (TPA) for 2022 and the ![concrete dataset](data/concrete.csv) . In Part 1 of the project, my primary objective was to recreate six graphs that incorporated faceting and ridges. To achieve this, I transformed the "month" numeric column into written characters using the as.factor function. This conversion returned the original object with the specified column transformed into a factor instead of a numeric value. In part 2 explored Concrete dataset and analysed distribution of the continuous variables available in the dataset and made visualizations. 

**Compression strength distribution box plot:**
The plot observe horizontal patterns for each color, which shows there are multiple segments in the data. This shows specific combination of materials create a certain compressive strength. And changing that mixture combination can change the compressive strength.

### Moving Forward

I have gained extensive knowledge in areas such as design principles, ggplot, grammar of graphics, spatial visualization, interactive plots, and reproducible research. This newfound understanding has greatly enhanced my analytical and coding abilities. I am motivated to continue my learning journey and apply these skills to diverse datasets in the future.
